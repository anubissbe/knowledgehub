## Remaining Issues

### High Priority (Blocking Features)
1. **Decision Recording**: Field name conflicts in SQLAlchemy model
2. **Public Search**: Enum value and field name mismatches with Weaviate
3. **Session Handoff**: Implementation error in handoff creation

### Medium Priority
1. **Background Jobs**: Failed to start due to cache service import error
2. **Pattern Workers**: Same cache service issue
3. **Proactive Assistance**: Some endpoints not fully implemented

### Low Priority
1. **SSE Streaming**: Authentication/CORS issues
2. **Empty Implementations**: Some endpoints return empty arrays (intentional stubs)

## Progress Summary
- **Phase 1 (Authentication)**: ✅ Complete
- **Phase 2 (Background Jobs)**: ⚠️ Partial (cache service issue)
- **Phase 3 (Missing Features)**: ✅ Complete  
- **Phase 4 (Real-time)**: ⚠️ Partial (SSE auth issues)
- **Phase 5 (Pattern Recognition)**: ✅ Complete (basic)
- **Phase 6 (Testing/Monitoring)**: ✅ Complete

## Next Steps
1. Fix decision recording model issues
2. Fix public search Weaviate schema
3. Fix cache service import for background jobs
4. Implement remaining proactive assistance features
5. Fix SSE authentication

**Current Operational Status: ~70%**
**Estimated Time to 100%: 4-6 hours of focused development**
