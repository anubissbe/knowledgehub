# ProjectHub Task Status - KnowledgeHub Project

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify automated backups
crontab -l | grep backup

# Check API errors (should be 0)
docker logs knowledgehub-api 2>&1 | grep -c AssertionError

# Verify health checks
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}" | grep knowledgehub

# Check disk usage (should be <50%)
df -h /

# Verify log rotation
ls -la /opt/projects/knowledgehub/config/logrotate.conf

# Check Grafana dashboards
ls -la /opt/projects/knowledgehub/dashboards/
```

## Summary

**ALL tasks in the KnowledgeHub project have been completed**, including:
- 2 High Priority tasks
- 9 Medium Priority tasks (2 real + 7 duplicate health checks)
- 2 Low Priority tasks

The only issue is that ProjectHub's API doesn't support updating task status, so the original tasks still show as "pending" even though they're complete.
