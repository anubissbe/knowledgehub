# KnowledgeHub Console Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Endpoint Configuration (404 Errors)
**Problem**: Frontend was making requests to wrong API endpoints when accessed from LAN machines.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Created environment configuration files (`.env.development` and `.env.production`)
- Modified `/frontend/src/services/api.ts` to dynamically determine API URL based on hostname
- Added logic to detect LAN access (192.168.1.x) and construct correct API URL
- Fixed memory endpoint path from `/api/memory/recent` to `/api/v1/memories/recent`
- Added missing `/recent` endpoint to the memories router in correct order (before `/{memory_id}`)

### 2. DataGrid Errors (Cannot read properties of undefined)
**Problem**: MUI DataGrid was trying to access properties on undefined row objects.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added null-safety checks to all `valueGetter` functions in MemorySystem.tsx
- Changed `params.row` to `params?.row` to handle undefined params

### 3. React Router Deprecation Warnings
**Problem**: React Router v6 showing warnings about future v7 changes.

**Solution Applied**:
- Enabled future flags in BrowserRouter: `v7_startTransition` and `v7_relativeSplatPath`
- Updated `/frontend/src/main.tsx` to include future flags

### 4. Development Build Warnings
**Note**: The vis-data and React DevTools warnings are informational and don't require fixes. They simply indicate:
- You're running development builds (expected in dev environment)
- React DevTools browser extension is available for better debugging

## How to Apply Changes

1. **Backend Changes**: The API changes are already active since the server is running.

2. **Frontend Changes**: Restart the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/projects/knowledgehub/frontend
   # Kill existing process
   pkill -f "vite.*--port 3101"
   # Restart
   npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3101
   ```

3. **For Production Deployment**:
   - Use the `.env.production` file when building
   - Run: `npm run build`
   - Deploy the built files

## Testing

After applying these fixes:
1. Access KnowledgeHub from a LAN machine: http://192.168.1.25:3100
2. Navigate to the Memory System page
3. Check browser console - all 404 errors should be resolved
4. DataGrid should display without errors
5. React Router warnings should be gone

## LAN Access Configuration

The system now automatically detects and configures API URLs based on access location:
- **Local Development** (localhost): Uses Vite proxy
- **LAN Access** (192.168.1.x): Automatically constructs API URL as `http://{hostname}:3000`
- **Production**: Uses VITE_API_URL environment variable if set
