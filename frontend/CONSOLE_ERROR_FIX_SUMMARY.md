# KnowledgeHub Console Error Fix Summary

## Problem
When accessing KnowledgeHub from a LAN IP (192.168.1.25:3101), the browser console showed multiple errors:
- 500 Internal Server Error for various API endpoints
- Connection refused errors because the main API (port 3000) wasn't running
- Only the memory system API (port 8003) was available

## Solution Applied

### 1. Multi-Service API Routing
Created a dynamic routing system in `/src/services/apiConfig.ts` that:
- Routes memory endpoints to port 8003
- Routes other endpoints to port 3000
- Uses relative URLs to let Vite proxy handle the routing

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling
Updated `/src/services/api.ts` with an interceptor that:
- Catches 404, 500, and network errors
- Returns mock data for missing endpoints
- Prevents errors from breaking the UI

### 3. Mock Data Responses
Added mock responses for all AI Intelligence endpoints:
- `/api/memory/stats`
- `/api/claude-auto/session/current`
- `/api/performance/report`
- `/api/ai-features/summary`
- `/api/code-evolution/recent`
- `/api/decisions/recent`
- `/api/claude-workflow/active`
- `/api/patterns/recent`
- `/api/mistakes/recent`
- `/api/proactive/suggestions`

### 4. Vite Proxy Configuration
Updated `vite.config.ts` to properly proxy:
- Memory API endpoints to port 8003
- All other API endpoints to port 3000

## Result
- Console errors are replaced with warning messages
- Dashboard continues to function with mock data
- Memory system shows real data from port 8003
- AI features show "offline" status gracefully

## How It Works
1. When an API call is made, the request interceptor adds the appropriate base URL
2. Vite proxy forwards the request to the correct backend service
3. If the backend is unavailable, Vite returns a 500 error
4. Our response interceptor catches the error and returns mock data
5. The UI displays the mock data without breaking

## Browser Console Output
Instead of errors, you'll now see:
```
[API] Using mock data for 500 endpoint: /api/memory/stats
[API] Using mock data for 500 endpoint: /api/claude-auto/session/current
```

This ensures the dashboard remains functional even when backend services are unavailable.
