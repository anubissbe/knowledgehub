High-Level Design for a Production-Grade Agentic RAG System with Claude Code: An Architectural BlueprintPart I: Foundational Architecture - A Production-Grade RefinementThis document presents a definitive architectural blueprint for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to augment the Anthropic Claude Code agent. It refines and enhances the initial high-level design by introducing production-grade components, robust security paradigms, and advanced architectural patterns. The resulting system will provide Claude Code with a secure, scalable, and continuously updated external knowledge base, serving as both a long-term memory and an expert on current technical documentation. This addresses the core limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)—knowledge cutoffs and the potential for hallucination—by grounding the agent's responses in verifiable, up-to-date information.Section 1: Core System Architecture and Component Deep DiveThe foundation of a high-performance RAG system rests on the careful selection and configuration of its core components. Each choice must be justified not only by its features but also by its alignment with the system's primary goal: delivering low-latency, high-relevance information to a developer assistant. This section dissects each component, providing rigorous, data-driven justifications for the recommended technology stack and outlining production-level configurations.1.1 The RAG Orchestration Engine: Selecting the Right FrameworkThe orchestration engine is the central nervous system of the RAG pipeline, managing data ingestion, indexing, and retrieval. The selection of this framework is a critical architectural decision that dictates the system's performance, flexibility, and maintainability. While several frameworks exist, the choice between the leading contenders—LlamaIndex, LangChain, and Haystack—hinges on their underlying design philosophies.A detailed comparative analysis reveals distinct architectural approaches. LangChain is a comprehensive, agent-first framework designed for orchestrating complex, multi-step workflows involving various tools and LLM calls.1 Its strength lies in its flexibility and broad integration capabilities.3 However, its high level of abstraction, while powerful for general-purpose agentic applications, can introduce performance overhead and debugging complexity in retrieval-heavy tasks.3 Haystack, developed by deepset, is an enterprise-focused, pipeline-based framework optimized for production-ready search and Question-Answering (QA) systems.2 Its modular, opinionated architecture provides a clear path for building robust search pipelines, but its ecosystem is more contained than its competitors.3LlamaIndex, in contrast, is fundamentally a data-first framework, specializing in the high-performance indexing and retrieval of data to be fed into LLMs.3 Its architecture is less abstract and more directly focused on optimizing the RAG pipeline itself, offering superior performance for data-intensive search tasks and a gentler learning curve for RAG-specific development.1FeatureLlamaIndexLangChainHaystackArchitectural PhilosophyData-First: Optimized for indexing and retrieval to feed LLMs.Agent-First: Focused on orchestrating complex, multi-step agentic workflows.Pipeline-First: Enterprise-focused, modular pipelines for search and QA.Primary Use CaseHigh-performance RAG, knowledge management systems.1Complex tool-using agents, API chaining, dynamic applications.2Production-grade enterprise search, document analysis, QA systems.2PerformanceExcellent for data ingestion and retrieval; less abstraction overhead.1Can have performance overhead due to deep abstraction layers.3Strong performance in production deployments, optimized for search pipelines.3Ease of Use & FlexibilityMore direct and less "magic," offering fine-grained control over the data layer.1High flexibility with many components, but can have a steep learning curve.1Opinionated pipeline structure is easier to start with but can be less flexible.2Ecosystem & CommunityLarge and rapidly growing community with extensive data source connectors (LlamaHub).1Very large ecosystem with broad integrations across models and tools.2Smaller, more curated ecosystem, potentially leading to higher component quality.3Recommendation and Justification:For this system, whose paramount function is to augment a coding assistant with fresh documentation, the performance and specialization of the retrieval component are non-negotiable. Therefore, LlamaIndex is the optimal choice for the core RAG orchestration engine. The fundamental problem to be solved—outdated knowledge and hallucinations—is a data quality and retrieval problem. LlamaIndex's "data-first" philosophy directly aligns with this requirement.1This selection is not merely a library choice but a deliberate architectural decision. A general-purpose, agent-first framework like LangChain encourages building a single, monolithic application where agentic reasoning and data retrieval logic are tightly coupled. This can make it difficult to scale and optimize the performance-critical retrieval component independently. By contrast, LlamaIndex's specialized nature lends itself to being encapsulated as a dedicated "Knowledge API" for Claude Code. The architectural decision is to implement the retrieval logic as a dedicated, stateless microservice using a Python web framework like FastAPI, with LlamaIndex as its core library. This approach creates a clear separation of concerns: Claude Code is responsible for the high-level agentic reasoning, while our dedicated service is responsible for providing it with low-latency, high-quality data. This modular design is more robust and performant than attempting to optimize a general-purpose framework for a specialized task.1.2 The Vector Knowledge Store: Performance, Scalability, and CostThe vector database is the heart of the RAG system's memory, storing the numerical representations (embeddings) of the knowledge base. Its performance directly impacts the speed of every query. The choice must be based on empirical benchmarks, scalability features, and operational efficiency. The leading open-source, self-hostable candidates are Qdrant, Milvus, and Weaviate.Recent benchmarks consistently demonstrate Qdrant's superior performance in terms of query speed (Requests-Per-Second) and latency, particularly in scenarios involving metadata filtering, which is crucial for any production system.4 Qdrant's architecture, written in Rust, is engineered for efficiency and a small memory footprint, making it an excellent choice for containerized deployments.5 Milvus is a powerful, mature engine designed for massive-scale distributed deployments and excels at indexing speed, but its query performance lags behind Qdrant in many common scenarios.4 Weaviate offers compelling features like built-in hybrid search, but benchmarks indicate its query performance has not kept pace with Qdrant's advancements.4FeatureQdrantMilvusWeaviateQuery Performance (RPS)Highest in most benchmark scenarios.4Good, but lower than Qdrant in many tests.4Generally lower than Qdrant and Milvus.4Query LatencyLowest in most benchmark scenarios.4Higher than Qdrant, especially with more vectors.4Generally higher than Qdrant.8Indexing SpeedFast.Fastest among the three.4Good.Filtering PerformanceExcellent; uses advanced query planning to avoid performance degradation.4Good, but can be less performant than Qdrant.Good, offers built-in hybrid search.Quantization SupportYes (Scalar, Binary).Yes (PQ).Yes.On-Disk StorageYes, optimized for memory-mapped files.Yes, with disk-based storage and memory caching.Yes.Primary LanguageRust.5C++.Go.Recommendation and Production Configuration:Qdrant is the definitive choice for the vector knowledge store due to its superior query performance, efficiency, and ease of deployment in a containerized environment.4 For a production deployment, the following configurations are essential:Quantization: Enable Qdrant's built-in scalar or binary quantization. This technique dramatically reduces the memory footprint of the vectors by converting float32 values to int8 or binary representations, leading to significant cost savings and potentially faster searches with minimal impact on accuracy.8On-Disk Storage: Configure collections to store vectors on disk. This is a critical feature that allows the knowledge base to scale far beyond the available RAM, which is a necessity for a system designed to ingest extensive documentation.High-Availability (HA) Deployment: In a production environment, run Qdrant as a distributed cluster with multiple replicas to ensure fault tolerance and zero-downtime upgrades.While Qdrant is the best choice today, the vector database market is intensely competitive, with roadmaps promising significant future advancements like sharded HNSW from Qdrant ("Project Nebula") and serverless ingest from Milvus.5 This rapid innovation introduces a significant architectural risk: being locked into a single implementation. To mitigate this, the architecture must be designed for flexibility. The RAG orchestration service should interact with the vector store via the abstractions provided by LlamaIndex, which supports multiple backends.1 This decouples the application from a specific database implementation, allowing the system to adapt and migrate to a different vector store in the future if a compelling performance or feature advantage emerges. This approach future-proofs the system against market shifts.1.3 The Embedding Pipeline: The Criticality of Semantic RepresentationThe quality of the RAG system is fundamentally constrained by the semantic understanding of its embedding model. This model is responsible for translating text chunks into numerical vectors, and its ability to capture the nuances of technical language directly determines retrieval relevance. The choice lies between proprietary API-based models and self-hosted open-source models from sources like the Hugging Face MTEB leaderboard.9 While proprietary models offer high performance out-of-the-box, they introduce external dependencies, latency, and operational costs.Recommendation and Advanced Strategy:The recommended approach is to begin with a top-performing, self-hosted open-source model (e.g., a model from the BGE or GTE series) deployed in its own containerized service.9 This provides full control over the environment and avoids external API calls during the critical retrieval path.However, the key long-term strategy is to implement a fine-tuning pipeline for this embedding model. A generic model may struggle to differentiate between semantically adjacent but technically distinct concepts (e.g., a "hook" in React versus a "hook" in Python). By curating a dataset of (query, relevant_doc_snippet) pairs specific to software development, the embedding model can be fine-tuned to become an expert in the language of code and technical documentation.9This creates a virtuous cycle of improvement:Deploy the system with the initial model.Log user queries and the documents that lead to successful outcomes (e.g., code that the user accepts and uses).Use this logged data to create new training pairs for fine-tuning.Periodically retrain and deploy the updated embedding model.This process continuously increases the "semantic resolution" of the knowledge base, moving the system from simple keyword-like semantic search to true context-aware retrieval. The long-term performance gains from a domain-specialized embedding model will far outweigh the micro-optimizations of any other system component.1.4 The Ingestion Subsystem: From Raw Content to Enriched KnowledgeThe ingestion pipeline is where the ultimate quality and retrievability of the knowledge base are forged. It is not merely a pre-processing step but a critical stage of knowledge curation and enrichment.1.4.1 Dynamic Content Ingestion ServiceTo keep the knowledge base current, a robust web scraping service is required. This service must be capable of handling modern, JavaScript-heavy documentation sites. A comparison of the leading Node.js-based headless browser automation tools, Puppeteer and Playwright, reveals that Playwright is the more robust and future-proof choice. Its superior cross-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), more advanced built-in auto-waiting capabilities, and better stability at scale make it more reliable for complex automation tasks and less prone to detection by anti-scraping measures.10The scraping service must be architected for resilience and ethical operation, incorporating established best practices:Job Queue Management: Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Redis) to manage and schedule scraping tasks asynchronously.Ethical Scraping: Adhere to robots.txt policies, implement conservative rate limits and exponential backoff for retries, and use a transparent User-Agent string that identifies the bot and provides contact information.Caching: Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to store page content, preventing the re-downloading of unchanged documentation and reducing load on the target servers.Robust Error Handling: Implement circuit breakers to halt scraping if a high rate of errors is detected, preventing the system from overwhelming a struggling server.1.4.2 Advanced Chunking and Contextual EnrichmentA primary failure mode of naive RAG systems is the loss of context at chunk boundaries.12 A code snippet is often meaningless without the preceding paragraph that explains it. The most effective point to solve this problem is not during retrieval, but during ingestion. Investing in data quality at this stage provides a disproportionately large return on the overall system's performance.To address this fundamental flaw, this design incorporates a Contextual Enrichment technique as a mandatory step in the ingestion pipeline.14 The implementation is as follows:A document is split into initial text chunks using a structure-aware method (e.g., recursive splitting based on Markdown headers).15For each chunk, a call is made to an LLM (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet for cost-effectiveness) with a specific prompt, providing both the chunk itself and the full document text.The LLM is instructed to generate a concise summary of the chunk's surrounding context.This generated summary is prepended to the original chunk text.This new, enriched chunk (summary + original text) is what gets passed to the embedding model and indexed in the vector store.This technique effectively "re-injects" lost context into each retrievable unit, transforming them from isolated text snippets into self-contained, context-aware packets of knowledge. This moves beyond simple pre-processing to a stage of active knowledge curation, directly mitigating the root cause of many retrieval failures and hallucinations.Section 2: Claude Code Integration - A Secure and Performant BridgeThe interface between the RAG system and Claude Code is the most critical and security-sensitive part of the architecture. The design must provide a bridge that is not only efficient but also hardened against potential exploits.2.1 Integration Patterns: Hooks vs. Model Context Protocol (MCP)Anthropic provides two primary mechanisms for integrating external functionality with Claude Code: Hooks and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).16Hooks: Hooks are a direct and simple way to trigger actions at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle. The UserPromptSubmit hook, for example, fires whenever a user submits a prompt, allowing an external command to run and inject context before the LLM processes the query.17 This approach is proactive, ensuring that grounding context is always provided. However, it carries a significant security warning from Anthropic: "USE AT YOUR OWN RISK," as the hook command executes with the user's full system permissions.17Model Context Protocol (MCP): MCP is an open standard designed to connect AI models to external tools and data sources in a structured way.18 By implementing an MCP server, our RAG service can be exposed to Claude Code as a "tool" (e.g., search_docs). The agent can then decide agentically when to call this tool.16 This approach is more reactive and flexible but relies on the model to "know what it doesn't know" and decide to seek external information. It is also more complex to implement, requiring a dedicated MCP server.20FeatureHooks (UserPromptSubmit)Model Context Protocol (MCP)Implementation ComplexityLow: Configure a single command in a JSON file.17High: Requires building and maintaining a dedicated MCP server.20Execution ModelProactive: Automatically triggers on every user prompt.Reactive: The agent decides when to call the tool.Security ModelHigh Risk (by default): Executes arbitrary commands with user permissions. Requires explicit sandboxing.17Lower Risk: Structured communication protocol. The agent calls a defined tool, not an arbitrary shell command.18FlexibilityLower: A single, predefined action is taken.Higher: The agent can call the tool with different parameters as part of a multi-step plan.Recommended Use CaseGuaranteed context injection for every query to combat hallucinations.Complex, multi-step research tasks where the agent needs to decide what to search for.Recommendation:For the foundational architecture, the Hook-based approach is recommended. Its proactive nature directly addresses the primary goal of grounding every response and preventing hallucinations by ensuring context is always injected. This deterministic approach is more reliable for solving the core knowledge-gap problem than relying on the agent's discretion to call an MCP tool.However, the RAG service's API should be designed from the outset to be compatible with MCP. This means having a clean, well-defined API endpoint (e.g., POST /query) that can later be easily wrapped by an MCP server. This ensures forward compatibility and allows the system to evolve to support both integration patterns. A mature system might use a UserPromptSubmit hook to inject high-level project context and conversational memory, while also providing an MCP tool for more targeted, deep searches that the agent can initiate.2.2 Hardened Hook Implementation and SecurityThe convenience of Claude Code hooks comes with a severe security responsibility. A naive implementation that simply calls a shell script is a critical vulnerability. If a malicious prompt could exploit a command injection flaw in that script, an attacker could gain arbitrary code execution with the user's permissions.17To mitigate this, the design mandates a non-negotiable security control: the hook command must be executed within a secure, ephemeral, and heavily restricted Docker sandbox. This approach acknowledges the inherent risk of the hook mechanism and builds a robust architectural defense against it.The secure execution flow is as follows:The UserPromptSubmit hook in the settings.json file will not call a script directly. Instead, it will execute a docker run command.This command will launch a purpose-built, short-lived sandbox container.The prompt from the user is passed into the container via standard input.The script inside the container makes a network call to the RAG service API, receives the context, and prints it to standard output.Claude Code captures this standard output and injects it into the prompt.17The sandbox container is immediately destroyed upon completion (--rm).This sandbox container must be hardened with the following configuration 21:Minimal Base Image: Built from a distroless or alpine image to minimize the attack surface.Non-Root User: The process inside the container runs as a dedicated, unprivileged user.Read-Only Filesystem: The container's root filesystem is mounted as read-only (--read-only) to prevent any modifications.Restricted Networking: The container has no access to the public internet. It is attached only to a private Docker network, allowing it to communicate exclusively with the RAG service (--network=internal-net).No Host Access: No volumes are mounted from the host machine, preventing any access to the user's files.Strict Resource Limits: CPU and memory usage are tightly constrained (--memory, --cpus) to prevent denial-of-service attacks.No Privileges: The container is run with --cap-drop=ALL to remove all Linux capabilities and --security-opt=no-new-privileges to prevent privilege escalation.This sandboxing architecture effectively re-establishes the security boundary that the hook mechanism otherwise bypasses. It ensures that even if the script inside the container were to be compromised, the attacker would be trapped in a sterile environment with no tools, no network access, and no path to the host system, mitigating the risk identified by Anthropic.Section 3: System-Wide Concerns for Production ReadinessElevating the design from a functional prototype to a production-grade system requires addressing critical non-functional requirements, including holistic security, operational scalability, and user-centric transparency.3.1 A Holistic Security Framework for Agentic RAGBeyond the critical hook sandbox, a comprehensive RAG system presents a unique attack surface that must be secured at every layer. The security framework must address the following vulnerabilities based on established best practices, such as the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 21:Data Ingestion Security: To prevent data poisoning attacks (LLM03/LLM04), where an attacker injects malicious or misleading information into the knowledge base, all data sources must be validated.23 The ingestion pipeline must sanitize all incoming text to strip out potential scripts or malformed data.Data Storage Security: All data within the vector database must be encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms like AES-256. Furthermore, a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism must be implemented. In an enterprise setting, developers may have access to different sets of documentation (e.g., public vs. proprietary). The RAG service must be aware of the user's identity (which can be passed securely with the hook request) and filter the retrieved results to ensure users only see data they are authorized to access.Retrieval Security: The system must be hardened against prompt injection attacks (LLM01).23 A malicious user might craft a query designed to manipulate the retrieval process, for example, by adding instructions to ignore previous context and only retrieve from a specific, potentially malicious, document. Query validation and sanitization at the RAG service API gateway are essential.Generation and Data Leakage Security: A critical risk is the inadvertent leakage of sensitive information (LLM02/LLM06).24 The LLM might retrieve a chunk containing confidential data (e.g., an internal API key from a private document) and include it in a response that is then shared publicly. To mitigate this, a response-level filtering layer must be implemented.27 This layer can scan the LLM's generated output for sensitive patterns (e.g., secrets, PII) before it is displayed to the user.3.2 Deployment, Scalability, and OperationalizationWhile a Docker Compose setup is suitable for local development, a production deployment requires a more robust orchestration platform like Kubernetes.28 This enables automated scaling, resilience, and operational management.Deployment Architecture: The system will be deployed as a set of microservices on Kubernetes. Each component (RAG Service, Scraper Service, Qdrant, UI) will have its own Kubernetes Deployment and Service manifest.30 An Ingress controller will manage external access to the UI and API endpoints.31Scalability: The stateless components, such as the RAG service and the scraper service, will be configured with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs).32 These HPAs will automatically scale the number of running pods up or down based on real-time CPU and memory utilization, ensuring the system can handle fluctuating loads without manual intervention.34 The Qdrant vector database will be deployed as a StatefulSet to manage its clustered state and persistent storage.Monitoring and Logging: A comprehensive monitoring and logging stack is non-negotiable for production. Prometheus will be used to scrape and store metrics from all system components.31 Grafana will provide dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators, such as query latency, retrieval throughput, and resource consumption. For logging, a centralized solution like the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a more lightweight alternative like Loki will be deployed to aggregate logs from all containers, enabling efficient debugging and auditing.363.3 The Transparency and Control Plane (UI)The web-based UI serves as a critical interface for developers to trust and manage the RAG system. It must be more than a simple document browser; it should be a comprehensive control and evaluation dashboard designed with best practices for AI UIs in mind, such as providing transparency and control.37Retrieval Evaluation and Tuning: The UI will include a dedicated section for evaluating the performance of the RAG pipeline.39 Developers can enter a query and see not only the retrieved chunks but also their relevance scores. For more advanced use cases, if a "golden set" of questions and ideal documents is created, the UI can calculate and display core information retrieval metrics like precision, recall, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). This turns the UI into a powerful tool for continuous improvement.Data Source Lifecycle Management: The dashboard will provide a complete interface for managing the lifecycle of knowledge sources.40 Users can add new documentation URLs, trigger manual re-scraping and re-indexing jobs, configure automated refresh schedules (e.g., via cron expressions), and view the version history and ingestion status of each source.Security and Audit Dashboard: For administrators, the UI will feature a security dashboard that provides access to audit logs. This will display all retrieval queries, the user who made them, and the documents that were returned. It will also highlight security-relevant events, such as failed authorization attempts or blocked queries, providing crucial visibility for compliance and threat monitoring.Part II: Advanced Architectural Patterns and Future DirectionsThe foundational architecture described in Part I delivers a robust, secure, and performant RAG system that solves the immediate problems of knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Part II explores the evolution of this system, introducing state-of-the-art architectural patterns that unlock new capabilities for complex reasoning, deeper understanding, and persistent, human-like memory.Section 4: Evolving to a Multi-Agent System for Complex Reasoning4.1 The Case for Multi-Agent RAG in Software DevelopmentWhile the foundational RAG system excels at answering fact-based questions, complex software development tasks are rarely monolithic. A task like "Refactor this component to use the new v2 API, improve its performance, and ensure it adheres to our internal style guide" requires synthesizing information from multiple, disparate sources: the v2 API documentation, performance best practices, the local codebase, and the style guide document.A single-agent RAG system, which performs one retrieval and one generation step, struggles with such multi-faceted problems. A multi-agent RAG system, where multiple specialized agents collaborate, represents a more powerful and scalable paradigm.42 This approach mirrors how a human development team would tackle the problem: one person reads the API docs, another analyzes the existing code, and then they collaborate to produce the solution. This evolution represents a shift from simple "information retrieval" to sophisticated "problem decomposition and synthesis".454.2 An Orchestrator-Worker Architecture for Code IntelligenceThe proposed advanced architecture is based on the orchestrator-worker pattern, a common and effective model for multi-agent systems.46 In this model, the simple RAG service is replaced by a more intelligent orchestration engine that manages a team of specialized worker agents. This architecture directly addresses the goal of helping the AI "not lose the plot" during complex tasks. The Orchestrator Agent explicitly creates and manages the "plot" by decomposing the high-level goal into a structured plan. This provides a more fundamental solution to maintaining context and coherence than simply providing a larger, unstructured block of information.RoleResponsibilitiesKey Tools UsedOrchestrator/Planner AgentDecomposes the user's high-level query into a logical sequence of sub-tasks. Manages the workflow and passes context between agents.43LLM-based planning capabilities.Documentation Research AgentExecutes sub-tasks related to finding information in external knowledge bases.The RAG retrieval API (interfacing with Qdrant).Codebase Analysis AgentExecutes sub-tasks related to reading and understanding the user's local project files.Filesystem read/write tools, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsers.Synthesis AgentReceives the outputs from the worker agents and synthesizes them into a final, coherent response or code implementation.LLM-based generation capabilities.Workflow Example:For the query, "Refactor this component to use the new v2 API," the workflow would be:User Query: The user submits the query to Claude Code.Orchestrator Agent: The hook triggers the Orchestrator Agent. It analyzes the query and creates a plan:Step 1: "Use the Documentation Research Agent to find the migration guide and key function signatures for the v2 API."Step 2: "Use the Codebase Analysis Agent to read the current implementation of the component."Step 3: "Pass the v2 API info and the current code to the Synthesis Agent to generate the refactored code."Worker Execution: The Orchestrator dispatches each task to the appropriate worker agent in sequence.47Final Response: The Synthesis Agent produces the final refactored code, which is returned to Claude Code.Section 5: The Power of Connected Knowledge - Graph-Based Memory and Retrieval5.1 GraphRAG for Code and Documentation IntelligenceStandard vector search treats text as a "bag of words," losing the rich structural information inherent in code and documentation. Code is a graph of function calls, class inheritance, and module dependencies. Documentation is a graph of cross-references and conceptual hierarchies. A retrieval method that ignores this structure is fundamentally lossy.GraphRAG is a superior approach for this domain. It involves creating a knowledge graph from the source data, where entities (like functions, classes, API endpoints) are nodes and their relationships (calls, inherits from, depends on) are edges.48 Queries can then leverage both semantic vector search and structured graph traversal, enabling far more sophisticated reasoning.48 For example, a GraphRAG system can answer a query like, "Show me all functions that are affected by the deprecation of the v1_auth function," a task that is nearly impossible for a standard vector search RAG system.This can be implemented using LlamaIndex's PropertyGraphIndex, which provides tools to automatically extract entities and relationships from text using an LLM and construct a graph.50 This graph can then be queried to retrieve interconnected subgraphs of information, providing a much richer and more precise context to the LLM.5.2 A Persistent Cognitive Core: Implementing Long-Term Conversational Memory with ZepThe user's desire for "long-term memory" points to the need for a persistent, evolving record of the conversation and project context. While it is possible to store conversational history in the same vector database as the documentation, this is a suboptimal approach. A specialized solution is required to differentiate between universal, factual knowledge and personal, episodic memory.Zep is an open-source, purpose-built service for AI agent memory.52 It is not just a vector store; it is a temporal knowledge graph that automatically summarizes interactions, extracts key entities, and tracks how facts and relationships change over time.53 It has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on memory benchmarks, outperforming alternatives like MemGPT.55The proposed architecture integrates Zep as a dedicated, second memory store, creating a hybrid memory system:The "Library": The Qdrant vector store holds the static, universal knowledge base of technical documentation.The "Diary": The Zep memory store holds the dynamic, episodic memory of the specific conversation and project context.During the UserPromptSubmit hook, the system performs two retrievals in parallel: one from the documentation "library" and one from the conversational "diary." Both sets of context are then injected into the prompt. This allows the agent to access both general knowledge ("How does this library work?") and specific, contextual memory ("What did we decide about the database schema an hour ago?").This two-part brain architecture—separating universal, factual knowledge from personal, episodic memory—is far more powerful and closer to human cognition than a single, monolithic knowledge base. It allows the agent to clearly distinguish between what is true for everyone (the API docs) and what is true for this specific interactive session, fully realizing the goal of a context-aware, long-term AI partner.Conclusion and Strategic Implementation RoadmapThis architectural blueprint provides a comprehensive path to building a state-of-the-art, production-grade RAG system for Claude Code. By combining a hardened foundational architecture with advanced patterns for agentic reasoning and memory, the proposed system directly addresses the core challenges of LLM-based assistants, transforming Claude Code into a consistently reliable, knowledgeable, and context-aware development partner.Summary of Key Recommendations:Foundational Architecture: Build a modular, containerized system using LlamaIndex for RAG orchestration and Qdrant for high-performance vector storage.
