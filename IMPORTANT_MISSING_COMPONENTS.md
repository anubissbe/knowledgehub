# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Missing Components for Full Installation

This repository contains the **backend API code** for KnowledgeHub, but is missing several critical components needed for a complete installation:

## üö® Missing Components:

### 1. **Frontend/Web UI**
- The React/TypeScript frontend application (port 3100) is NOT included
- No UI components, dashboard, or visualization code
- Would need to be built separately

### 2. **Database Migrations**
- The `/migrations` folder is empty
- No database initialization scripts
- Tables won't be created automatically

### 3. **Complete Docker Configuration**
- The included `docker-compose.yml` is incomplete
- Use `docker-compose.complete.yml` as a reference for all services
- Some service configurations may need adjustment

### 4. **Installation Scripts**
- No `install.sh` script as mentioned in README
- Manual setup required

## üîß To Get Started:

1. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   # You'll need to manually create database schemas
   # Run the SQL files in api/database/ manually
   ```

2. **Use Complete Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.complete.yml docker-compose.yml
   # Edit environment variables as needed
   ```

3. **Frontend Alternative**:
   - Access the API directly at http://localhost:3000/docs
   - Build your own frontend using the API
   - Or use the API with tools like Postman

4. **Missing Services**:
   - Some features may not work without the AI service
   - The frontend dashboard won't be available

## ‚úÖ What IS Included:

- Complete FastAPI backend with all 8 AI Intelligence systems
- API endpoints for all features
- Database models and schemas
- Security middleware
- Learning and memory systems

## üöÄ Minimal Setup:

For a minimal API-only setup:
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/anubissbe/knowledgehub.git
cd knowledgehub

# 2. Create .env from example
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start only core services
docker-compose up postgres redis

# 4. Run API directly with Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python start_api.py
```

**Note**: This will give you a working API, but without the full UI and some advanced features.
