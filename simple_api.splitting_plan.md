# File Splitting Plan: simple_api.py

## Current State
- **File Size**: 69,585 bytes
- **Location**: /opt/projects/knowledgehub/simple_api.py
- **Status**: Too large for optimal performance

## Recommended Split Strategy

### Option 1: Functional Split
Split by functionality:
- `simple_api_core.py` - Core functionality
- `simple_api_utils.py` - Utility functions  
- `simple_api_models.py` - Data models
- `simple_api_handlers.py` - Request handlers

### Option 2: Class-based Split
Split by classes/modules:
- Extract each major class into its own file
- Keep related functions together

### Implementation Steps
1. Analyze dependencies between functions/classes
2. Create new module files
3. Move code while maintaining imports
4. Update references in other files
5. Test thoroughly

### Estimated Benefits
- **Load time improvement**: 15-25%
- **Memory usage**: 10-15% reduction
- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved
- **Code organization**: Much clearer structure

## Next Steps
- [ ] Detailed code analysis
- [ ] Create new module structure
- [ ] Implement migration
