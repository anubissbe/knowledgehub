```

## Access Points

- **API Documentation**: http://192.168.1.25:3000/docs
- **Web UI**: http://192.168.1.25:3101
- **AI Dashboard**: http://192.168.1.25:3101/ai
- **Neo4j Browser**: http://192.168.1.25:7474
- **MinIO Console**: http://192.168.1.25:9011

## Recommendations

1. **Rebuild AI Service Image**: Include curl in the Docker image for proper health checks
2. **API Integration**: Consider integrating memory endpoints into main API
3. **Documentation**: Update port references (Web UI is 3101, not 3100)
4. **Monitoring**: All services should have health checks configured

## Conclusion

The KnowledgeHub system is **fully functional** and ready for use. All core features are operational, databases are connected, and the AI Intelligence features are active. The system provides a comprehensive AI-enhanced development intelligence platform as designed.
