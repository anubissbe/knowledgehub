# RAG Testing Framework

## Test Structure
- unit/: Unit tests for individual RAG components
- integration/: Integration tests for end-to-end RAG workflows  
- performance/: Performance and load tests
- fixtures/: RAG-specific test fixtures and data
- utils/: Testing utilities and helpers

## Coverage Requirements
- >80% code coverage for all RAG components
- >90% coverage for critical RAG pipeline paths
- 100% coverage for RAG configuration and initialization

## Performance Benchmarks
- Chunking: <100ms for 10KB documents
- Retrieval: <200ms for top-10 results
- End-to-end: <500ms for simple queries
- Memory usage: <1GB for standard test suite

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Memory leak detection
- Thread safety validation
