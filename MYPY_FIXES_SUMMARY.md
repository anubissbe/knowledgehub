# MyPy Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. SQLAlchemy Model Type Annotations
Fixed type annotations in SQLAlchemy models by removing explicit type annotations from Column assignments:

**Files Fixed:**
- `/src/api/models/knowledge_source.py` - Removed type annotations from all Column definitions
- `/src/api/models/document.py` - Fixed both Document and DocumentChunk classes
- `/src/api/models/job.py` - Fixed ScrapingJob class  
- `/src/api/models/memory.py` - Fixed MemoryItem class

**Pattern Changed:**
```python
# Before (incorrect - causes mypy errors)
id: uuid.UUID = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
name: str = Column(String(255), nullable=False)

# After (correct)
id = Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
name = Column(String(255), nullable=False)
```

### 2. Dictionary Access Type Safety
Fixed potential type issues in `resources.py` by adding isinstance check:

```python
# Added type guard
if isinstance(by_status, dict):
    by_status[status] = by_status.get(status, 0) + 1
```

## Why These Changes Were Needed

1. **SQLAlchemy Column Types**: At the class definition level, SQLAlchemy Column objects are descriptors that get replaced with actual values at runtime. Explicit type annotations confuse mypy because it expects the annotated type but sees a Column object instead.

2. **Runtime vs Definition Time**: SQLAlchemy models have different behaviors at definition time vs runtime:
   - Definition time: Attributes are Column objects
   - Runtime (instance): Attributes are the actual values
   
3. **Type Safety**: The isinstance check in resources.py ensures type safety when accessing nested dictionary values that mypy cannot fully infer.

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Query Filters**: The `.filter()` calls using `Model.column == value` are correct and should work with mypy. These produce `ColumnElement[bool]` which is the expected type.

2. **Optional Types**: Many files use `Optional` from typing, which is correct for nullable columns and optional parameters.

3. **JSON Columns**: JSON columns in SQLAlchemy are typed as `Dict[str, Any]` at runtime, which matches the removed annotations.

## Testing Recommendations

To verify these fixes work correctly with mypy, run:

```bash
# Install mypy and SQLAlchemy stubs
pip install mypy sqlalchemy-stubs types-redis types-requests

# Run mypy with common settings
mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports --no-strict-optional

# For stricter checking
mypy src/ --strict --ignore-missing-imports
```

## Additional Notes

- The models already had correct `to_dict()` methods that handle the runtime type conversions properly
- The base.py file was already correct and didn't need changes
- Models like auth.py and search.py were already using the correct pattern without type annotations
