# Health Check Implementation - Complete

**Date**: 2025-07-06  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Successfully added health checks to all remaining KnowledgeHub services that were missing them.

## Services Updated

### 1. API Gateway (knowledgehub-api)
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` (already existed)
- **Configuration Added**:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy

### 2. Web UI (knowledgehub-ui)  
- **Health Check**: HTTP check on nginx server
- **Configuration Added**:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:80"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```
- **Status**: ✅ Ready (static web server)

### 3. cAdvisor (knowledgehub-cadvisor)
- **Health Endpoint**: `/metrics`
- **Configuration Added**:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:8080/metrics"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy

## Complete Service Health Check Coverage

All KnowledgeHub services now have health checks:

| Service | Health Check Type | Status |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| PostgreSQL | pg_isready | ✅ |
| Redis | redis-cli ping | ✅ |
| Weaviate | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| MinIO | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| API Gateway | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| MCP Server | File-based | ✅ |
| Scraper | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| Scraper2 | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| RAG Processor | File-based | ✅ |
| Web UI | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| Scheduler | Python check | ✅ |
| AI Service | File-based | ✅ |
| Prometheus | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| Grafana | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| Node Exporter | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| cAdvisor | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |
| AlertManager | HTTP endpoint | ✅ |

## Benefits

1. **Container Orchestration**: Docker can properly manage service dependencies
2. **Monitoring**: Health status visible in `docker ps` and monitoring tools
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Unhealthy containers can be automatically restarted
4. **Load Balancer Integration**: Health checks enable proper load balancing
5. **Debugging**: Easier to identify and troubleshoot service issues

## Verification

Check all service health status:
```bash
# View all KnowledgeHub service health
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}" | grep knowledgehub

# Check specific service health
docker inspect knowledgehub-api | jq '.[0].State.Health'

# Monitor health check logs
docker events --filter event=health_status
```

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Appropriate Intervals**: 30s interval to avoid excessive checks
2. **Reasonable Timeouts**: 10s timeout for network operations
3. **Retry Logic**: 3 retries before marking unhealthy
4. **Endpoint Selection**: Using lightweight endpoints (/health, /metrics)
5. **Consistency**: Similar configuration across all services

## Next Steps

- Monitor health check performance impact
- Consider adding custom health endpoints for services using file-based checks
- Integrate health status with monitoring dashboards
- Set up alerts for unhealthy services
