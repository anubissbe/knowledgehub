## PostgreSQL Permission Issue Fix

### Problem
PostgreSQL container was failing with permission errors:
```
FATAL: could not open file "global/pg_filenode.map": Permission denied
```

### Root Cause
The PostgreSQL data directory was owned by UID 1000, but the postgres user in the container has UID 70.

### Solution
1. Stopped the PostgreSQL container
2. Fixed ownership using Alpine container:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v knowledgehub_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data alpine:latest \
     chown -R 70:70 /var/lib/postgresql/data
   ```
3. Restarted PostgreSQL container

### Result
- PostgreSQL now starts cleanly
- API can connect successfully
- All health checks pass

## Redis Connection Issue Fix

### Problem
API was showing Redis as "error" in health check despite Redis being operational.

### Solution
1. Restarted Redis container
2. Restarted API container to re-establish connection

### Result
- Redis connection restored
- Health check shows all services operational

## Verification
Comprehensive test suite confirms all functionality working:
- Session creation and caching ✅
- Memory CRUD operations ✅
- Vector search ✅
- Redis caching with TTL ✅
- All enum types working ✅
