# Claude Memory System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've designed and planned a comprehensive memory system to give Claude-Code persistent context across sessions. All tasks have been created in ProjectHub.

## What We've Created

### 1. Architecture Documentation
- **CLAUDE_MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Complete system design with diagrams
- **MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - Detailed 12-week implementation plan

### 2. ProjectHub Tasks
- **27 tasks** created across 4 phases
- **Epic task** to track overall progress
- Estimated **200+ hours** of development work

## Key Components

### Memory Service API
```bash
POST /api/memory/session/start      # Start new session
GET  /api/memory/context/load/{id}  # Load context for session
POST /api/memory/context/save       # Save conversation turn
POST /api/memory/search             # Search memories
```

### Core Features
1. **Session Management** - Track conversations across time
2. **Memory Extraction** - Extract facts, preferences, decisions
3. **Context Building** - Intelligently assemble relevant context
4. **Text Processing** - Intelligent text chunking with semantic boundaries
5. **Entity Extraction** - Named Entity Recognition with 18 entity types
6. **Fact Extraction** - Pattern-based fact extraction with 12 fact types
7. **Importance Scoring** - Multi-factor importance analysis for memory prioritization
4. **Smart Compression** - Fit context within token limits

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Database schema and models
- Basic session management
- Memory storage API
- **15 tasks created**

### Phase 2: Memory Processing (Weeks 3-4)
- Text processing pipeline
- Entity extraction
- Importance scoring
- Memory categorization
- **4 tasks created**

### Phase 3: Context Building (Weeks 5-6)
- Context engine
- Relevance scoring
- Token management
- Compression strategies
- **4 tasks created**

### Phase 4: Integration (Weeks 7-8)
- KnowledgeHub integration
- Session middleware
- Background processing
- Caching layer
- **4 tasks created**

## Quick Start (Once Implemented)

### For Claude-Code Users
```bash
# Start a new session
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/memory/session/start \
  -d '{"user_id": "user123", "project_id": "myproject"}'

# Claude-Code automatically:
# 1. Loads relevant context at start
# 2. Saves important information during conversation
# 3. Links related sessions

# Search your memories
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/memory/search \
  -d '{"query": "authentication implementation"}'
```

### Benefits
1. **"Remember our last conversation?"** - Yes!
2. **"Continue where we left off"** - Full context restored
3. **"You know my coding style"** - Preferences learned
4. **"What was that solution we discussed?"** - Searchable history

## Next Steps

1. **Review Tasks in ProjectHub**
   ```bash
   # View all memory system tasks
   curl http://192.168.1.24:3009/api/tasks?tags=memory-system
   ```

2. **Start Development**
   - Begin with Phase 1 database tasks
   - Set up development environment
   - Create initial models

3. **Track Progress**
   - Update tasks in ProjectHub
   - Regular architecture reviews
   - Performance benchmarking

## Success Metrics

- Context load time < 100ms
- Memory search < 50ms
- Context relevance > 80%
- Zero memory loss
- 99.9% availability

## Architecture Highlights

### Storage Layer
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- Redis for session cache
- Weaviate for vector search
- MinIO for conversation archives

### Processing Pipeline
```
Conversation → Extract → Categorize → Score → Store → Index
                  ↓          ↓          ↓       ↓       ↓
              Entities    Types    Importance  DB   Vectors
```

### Context Building
```
New Session → Load Recent → Find Relevant → Build Context → Inject
                 ↓              ↓               ↓            ↓
            Last N msgs    Vector Search    Compress    To Claude
```
