# ProjectHub API Task Update Workaround

**Date**: 2025-07-06  
**Issue**: PUT endpoint for updating tasks returns 500 Internal Server Error  
**Status**: Workaround implemented

## Problem

The ProjectHub API at `http://192.168.1.24:3009/api/tasks/{id}` fails with 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to update existing tasks using PUT requests. This affects the ability to mark tasks as completed or update their progress.

## Investigation Results

1. **GET requests work fine**: Can retrieve task lists and individual tasks
2. **POST requests work fine**: Can create new tasks with any status
3. **PUT requests fail**: Always return 500 error regardless of payload
4. **Authentication**: The API appears to have authentication issues but works without auth headers

## Workaround Solution

Since we cannot update existing tasks, we use the following workaround:

### For Completed Tasks
Create new tasks with "COMPLETED" suffix in the title and set status to "completed" during creation:

```javascript
// Instead of updating existing task
// await updateTask(taskId, { status: 'completed' })

// Create new completed task
await fetch('http://192.168.1.24:3009/api/tasks', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    project_id: projectId,
    title: originalTitle + ' - COMPLETED',
    description: detailedDescription,
    status: 'completed',
    priority: priority,
    actual_hours: hoursSpent,
    completed_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
});
```

## Tasks Created Using Workaround

1. **Automated Backup Implementation - COMPLETED**
   - Original: "Add automated backup procedures"
   - Status: Created as completed
   - Priority: High

2. **API WebSocket Assertion Error Fix - COMPLETED**
   - Original: "Fix API Assertion Errors"
   - Status: Created as completed
   - Priority: High

3. **Health Check Implementation - COMPLETED**
   - Original: "Add health checks for remaining services"
   - Status: Created as completed
   - Priority: Medium

## Future Considerations

1. The ProjectHub API needs debugging to fix the PUT endpoint
2. The authentication system needs investigation
3. Consider implementing a PATCH endpoint as an alternative
4. Database constraints might be causing the 500 errors

## Verification

Check that completed tasks are visible:
```bash
curl -s "http://192.168.1.24:3009/api/tasks" | \
  jq '.[] | select(.status == "completed" and (.title | contains("COMPLETED")))'
```
