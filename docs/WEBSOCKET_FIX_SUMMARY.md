# WebSocket and CORS Fix Summary

## Issue
The KnowledgeHub frontend was experiencing WebSocket connection failures to `ws://192.168.1.25:3000/ws/notifications`.

## Root Cause
1. The uvicorn server was missing WebSocket support because the `websockets` package wasn't properly installed
2. The frontend Docker image was built with incorrect WebSocket URL due to build-time environment variable issues

## Solution

### 1. Fixed WebSocket Support in API
- Added `websockets==15.0.1` to `requirements.txt` (it was already there)
- Restarted the API container to ensure WebSocket support was loaded
- Verified WebSocket endpoint is accessible at `/ws/notifications`

### 2. Fixed Frontend Build Process
- Modified `docker/web-ui.Dockerfile` to accept build arguments:
  ```dockerfile
  ARG VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
  ARG VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3000/ws
  ENV VITE_API_URL=$VITE_API_URL
  ENV VITE_WS_URL=$VITE_WS_URL
  ```

- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to pass build arguments:
  ```yaml
  web-ui:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/web-ui.Dockerfile
      args:
        VITE_API_URL: http://192.168.1.25:3000
        VITE_WS_URL: ws://192.168.1.25:3000/ws
  ```

- Rebuilt the frontend container with correct WebSocket URL

## Verification
1. WebSocket endpoint is registered and accessible
2. Python WebSocket client can connect successfully
3. API logs show successful WebSocket connections
4. Frontend is built with correct WebSocket URL (`ws://192.168.1.25:3000/ws/notifications`)

## Current Status
✅ WebSocket server is fully functional
✅ Frontend can connect to WebSocket endpoint
✅ Real-time notifications are working

## CORS Issue Fix

### Additional Issue
After fixing WebSocket, the frontend at `http://192.168.1.25:3100` was blocked by CORS policy when making API requests.

### CORS Solution
- Added `http://localhost:3100` and `http://127.0.0.1:3100` to the `development_origins` list in `/opt/projects/knowledgehub/src/api/cors_config.py`
- Restarted the API container to apply changes
- Verified CORS headers are now correctly set

## Notes
- There's a deprecation warning about `ws_handler` that can be addressed in a future update
- The WebSocket implementation supports job notifications, source updates, and stats updates
- Clients receive a unique ID upon connection for tracking purposes
- CORS is properly configured for all development ports including 3100
