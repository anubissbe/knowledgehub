## Additional Work Completed

### 4. ✅ ProjectHub API Investigation
- **Issue**: PUT endpoint returns 500 error, preventing task updates
- **Workaround**: Created new completed tasks instead of updating existing ones
- **Documentation**: `/opt/projects/knowledgehub/docs/PROJECTHUB_API_WORKAROUND.md`

## ProjectHub Status

Due to API limitations, the following approach was used:
- Original pending tasks remain unchanged in ProjectHub
- New tasks created with "COMPLETED" suffix to track completion
- All completed work is fully documented
