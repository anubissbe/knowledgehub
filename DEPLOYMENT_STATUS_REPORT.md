# KnowledgeHub Deployment Status Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the current deployment status of the KnowledgeHub production-grade RAG system implementation.

## Service Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Operational Services

1. **Core Database Services**
   - PostgreSQL (port 5433): ‚úÖ Healthy
   - Redis (port 6381): ‚úÖ Healthy
   - TimescaleDB (port 5434): ‚úÖ Healthy

2. **Vector & Graph Databases**
   - Weaviate (port 8090): ‚úÖ Running
   - Neo4j (ports 7474/7687): ‚úÖ Healthy
   - Qdrant (ports 6333/6334): ‚ö†Ô∏è Running but unhealthy (needs investigation)

3. **Object Storage**
   - MinIO (ports 9010/9011): ‚úÖ Healthy

4. **API Services**
   - Main API (port 3000): ‚úÖ Healthy and operational
   - AI Service (port 8002): ‚ö†Ô∏è Running but unhealthy (needs investigation)

5. **Memory Systems**
   - Zep (port 8100): ‚úÖ Started
   - Zep PostgreSQL: ‚úÖ Healthy

6. **Monitoring**
   - Grafana (port 3030): ‚úÖ Running
   - Prometheus: ‚úÖ Running

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

1. **Qdrant Vector Database**: Container is unhealthy
   - Status: Running but failing health checks
   - Action needed: Investigate logs and fix configuration

2. **AI Service**: Container is unhealthy
   - Status: Running but failing health checks
   - Action needed: Check embeddings service configuration

3. **Web UI**: Port conflict on 3100
   - Status: Cannot start due to port already in use
   - Action needed: Stop conflicting service or change port

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Core RAG Components ‚úÖ
- LlamaIndex orchestration engine implemented
- Qdrant vector database integrated (needs health check fix)
- Contextual chunk enrichment with LLMs
- Playwright-based documentation scraper
- Production-ready API with security features

### Phase 2: Advanced Memory & Security ‚úÖ
- Zep conversational memory system deployed
- RBAC with multi-tenant isolation implemented
- User management with JWT authentication
- Permission-based access control
- Audit logging system

### Phase 3: Multi-Agent Evolution ‚úÖ
- Multi-agent orchestrator framework implemented
- Query decomposition and routing
- Specialized agents (Technical, Business, Code, Data)
- Agent collaboration protocols
- Result synthesis and ranking

### Phase 4: GraphRAG (Pending) üîÑ
- Neo4j deployed and healthy
- PropertyGraphIndex implementation pending
- Knowledge graph construction pending
- Graph-based reasoning pending

## Next Steps

1. **Fix unhealthy services**:
   - Investigate Qdrant health check failures
   - Fix AI service embeddings configuration
   - Resolve Web UI port conflict

2. **Test implemented features**:
   - Test Zep memory functionality
   - Verify RBAC permissions work correctly
   - Test multi-agent orchestrator with real queries

3. **Complete GraphRAG implementation**:
   - Research Neo4j PropertyGraphIndex with LlamaIndex
   - Implement knowledge graph construction
   - Add graph-based reasoning capabilities

## Access Points

- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:3000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health
- **Grafana Dashboard**: http://localhost:3030
- **Neo4j Browser**: http://localhost:7474
- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9011

## Configuration Fixed

### Database Connection Issues Resolved:
1. Fixed hardcoded localhost:5433 references to use postgres:5432
2. Updated password from "knowledgehub" to "knowledgehub123"
3. Added proper DATABASE_URL environment variable
4. Fixed files:
   - `/api/models/base.py`
   - `/api/services/vault.py`
   - `/api/services/service_recovery.py`
   - `/api/routers/jobs.py`
   - `/api/config.py`

## Summary

The KnowledgeHub RAG system is largely operational with all three phases implemented. The main API is healthy and running, with most supporting services operational. Some services need attention for health check issues, and the Web UI has a port conflict that needs resolution. The system is ready for testing of Phase 2 (Zep/RBAC) and Phase 3 (Multi-Agent) features, with Phase 4 (GraphRAG) pending implementation.
