### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- ProjectHub was unavailable (not running on port 3009) - tasks could not be updated there
- All work has been documented in the KnowledgeHub project files
- Health check scripts are created dynamically in containers at `/tmp/`

## Quick Reference Commands

Check all health statuses:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}" | grep knowledgehub
```

Test individual health check:
```bash
docker exec <container> test -f /tmp/health && echo "healthy" || echo "unhealthy"
```

View health check configuration:
```bash
docker inspect <container> --format='{{.Config.Healthcheck.Test}}'
```
