# KnowledgeHub Source Code Recovery Notes

## Recovery Summary

The KnowledgeHub source code has been successfully recovered from the Docker images. The codebase includes:

### Core Components Recovered:

1. **API Backend** (`/api/`)
   - FastAPI-based REST API
   - All routers for AI Intelligence features
   - Memory system with session management
   - Learning system with pattern recognition
   - Integration with all backend services

2. **AI Service** (`/ai-service/`)
   - Main AI processing service
   - Runs on port 8002
   - Handles embeddings and AI analysis

3. **Configuration Files**
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Full service orchestration
   - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
   - `config.json` - Service configuration
   - `.env` - Environment variables

### Services Architecture:

The system runs with the following services:
- **API Gateway**: Port 3000 (FastAPI)
- **Web UI**: Port 3100 (React frontend - built files)
- **AI Service**: Port 8002 (AI processing)
- **PostgreSQL**: Port 5433 (main database)
- **TimescaleDB**: Port 5434 (time-series analytics)
- **Redis**: Port 6381 (caching)
- **Weaviate**: Port 8090 (vector search)
- **Neo4j**: Ports 7474/7687 (knowledge graph)
- **MinIO**: Port 9010 (object storage)

### Missing Components:

1. **Frontend Source Code**: Only the built React app was found in the nginx container. The original source code with components, styles, and build configuration is not in the Docker images.

2. **Development Scripts**: Build scripts, deployment scripts, and development tools.

3. **Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, and test configurations.

4. **Documentation**: Detailed API documentation, architecture diagrams, and development guides beyond the markdown files found.

### To Fully Restore:

1. The backend is fully functional with the recovered code
2. Frontend needs to be rebuilt from scratch or recovered from another source
3. All services can be started using the docker-compose.yml file
4. The system should work with the existing Docker containers

### Running the System:

```bash
# Using Docker Compose (recommended)
cd /opt/projects/knowledgehub
docker-compose up -d

# Or run the API directly
python start_api.py
```

### Next Steps:

1. Commit all recovered source code to git
2. Search for frontend source code backup
3. Create missing test files
4. Document the API endpoints
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline
